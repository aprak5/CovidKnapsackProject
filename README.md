# Covid-19 Knapsack Problem Project

This project focuses on the knapsack problem for Covid-19 cases between 10 counties where 3 hospitals will be opened. The knapsack problem in this case is to open the three hospitals to maximize the Covid-19 cases covered out of all other combinations of counties. 

## Prerequisites

Python is required for the project. The dependencies for the project are Callable (from typing), pandas, and itertools.

The NYcovidData.txt file has all NY Covid-19 cases and is required to run the project (must be in the same directory).

To install any missing dependencies, use `python -m pip install [pandas | itertools]`

## Run

To run the project, use `python "Covid Project.py"`
